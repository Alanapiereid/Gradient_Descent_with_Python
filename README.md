# Gradient_Descent_with_Python
Visualization of Gradient Descent for Linear Regression in Python


This is just a simple explanation and visualization of the following:

1) What gradient descent is intended for
2) What a cost function (here: mean squared error) does
3) A break down of the fundamental math
4) A visualization of the process
